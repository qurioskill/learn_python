"""
Real world has different kinds of data. We have strings such as our names,
we have integers such as our age, we have floating point numbers such as the value of Pi.
We are going to look at a few of them below.

Python internally supports a bunch of different data types. We are not going to be covering all
of them but we will look at some important ones.
"""

"""
Let us look at strings first. String basically represent character data such as names etc
Strings start and end with ("/'). 
"""
print("Madhav")
print('Avneet')

"""
Let us look at integers. Integers represent things such as age etc.
"""
print(1)
print(10)

"""
Let us look at floating point (decimal) numbers. Like the value of Pi
"""
print(3.14)

"""
Python also has a way to represent truthiness. We call them booleans.
"""
print(True)
print(False)

"""
There are more data types that exist, but we are going to restrict ourselves only to these for now.
"""

"""
Activity: 

Create a python file called data_types.py
Print a data of type string, integer, float (decimal) and boolean.
Choose things that you find relatable, like a movie, an important number etc.
